Good morning, everyone. Thank you for being punctual. Let's dive right in. First on the agenda is the status of the Alpha project. Nancy, could you give us an update? Certainly, Alex, the development team has completed 90% of the coding phase. We're on track to begin internal testing by the end of this week. However, we encountered a minor issue with the integration of the new API. What's the nature of the issue? The API documentation was updated recently, and some end points have changed. We're adjusting our code accordingly. But it has caused a slight delay. Understood. Do you need additional resources to expedite this? Additional support from the back end team would help us get back on schedule. I'll arrange that. Moving on, Paula, could you brief us on the marketing strategy for the product launch? Sure thing. Our campaign is set to kick off on November 1st. We're focusing on digital channels, social media, email marketing, and influencer partnerships. We've already lined up collaborations with key industry influencers to increase our reach. Have we allocated budget for paid promotions? Yes, we've allocated 20% more than last quarter to maximize visibility during the launch period. Sounds promising. Tyler, what about the sales projections? Based on current market trends and the enhanced features of our product, we're projecting a 15% increase in sales over the next quarter. The sales team is also setting up training sessions to familiarize themselves with the new product features. Excellent. Any concerns or obstacles we should be aware of? None at this moment. The team is motivated and ready. Great to hear. Now, about, about the customer feedback from the beta testers. Nancy, have you incorporated their suggestions? Yes, we've addressed most of the critical feedback. Some feature requests are being scheduled for the next update cycle to keep our launch timeline intact. On that note, can we highlight these upcoming features in our marketing materials? Absolutely. As long as we make it clear they're part of future updates. Good collaboration. Let's move on to action items. Nancy, coordinate with the backend team to resolve the API integration issue by Wednesday. Paula, finalize the marketing content and share it with the team by Friday for feedback. Consider it done. Tyler, schedule and conduct the sales team training sessions over the next 2 weeks. I'll send out the schedule today. I'll follow up on resource allocation and keep everyone updated on any changes. Does anyone have anything else to add? I'd like to propose a cross-departmental meeting next week to ensure alignment as we approach the launch date. Good idea. Let's schedule that. Anything else? No. Nothing from me. All right, thank you all for your contributions. Let's stay focused and maintain this momentum.
